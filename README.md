# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game, built with Python and the Turtle graphics library.

## Getting Started

To play the game, you will need to have Python 3 and the Turtle library installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Turtle by typing `pip install turtle` in your terminal or command prompt.

Once you have Python and Turtle installed, you can run the game by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory where the game files are located, and typing `python main.py`. This will launch the game window.

## How to Play

The game is a single-player game, where you control a snake that moves around the screen and eats food to grow longer. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without running into the walls or the snake's own body. The game ends if the snake crashes into the wall or its own body.

You can control the snake's direction using the arrow keys on your keyboard. The snake will move in the direction of the last arrow key you pressed.
